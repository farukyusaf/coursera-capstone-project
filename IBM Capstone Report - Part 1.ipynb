Moreover, it is also a common issue faced by many local and foreign tourists who to major metropolitans in Australia, however, they are overwhelmed by food choices. Hence, I will use this project to “explore” which major metropolitans in Australia are the best options for visiting restaurants and eateries offering “Middle Eastern” cuisine. The cities that I will analyze include; Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Perth and Brisbane. I will also use my previous background and experience in academia to consult literature resources while forming my arguments. \n",

For that purpose, I will use the Foursquare API to extract data of Middle Eastern restaurants in the cities under discussion. The major values from that data that are required for this project are the address, latitude and longitude. Moreover, for analysis purposes, Wikipedia and Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) will also be used to expand our analysis. In order to analyse our data and create dataframes, we will use pandas, numpy and folium (for maps) libraries. \n",
